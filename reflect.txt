|Workshop Reflection:3|
======================
Pseudo-code made this lab possible for me as breking down each issue I faced into many simple steps allowed me to 
more easily plan and prepare for the format of my code. This made the coding part go a lot quicker and require a lot more going back and fixing or adding things needed for later code. It was better to plan ahead as looking at the 
entirety of my code and thinking through what I would need as far as variables and other lines of code helped to save a lot of time and avoid many semantic errors.

The 3 types of iteration constructs are do while while and for. I used the for loop in order to do the inputs and 
store each input as the user is inputting them. I used a while statement in order so set velues for which a user input would be considered incorrect. I used this within the for this task because I was more practiced with the wile loop rather than do while. 

I found the most dificult portion of this excersise to be creating a manner in which my code would be able to output the maximum and minimum temperatures.
